    <string name="paragraphtermandcondition">“Terms and Conditions” is the document governing the contractual relationship between the provider of a service and its user. On the web, this document is often also called “Terms of Service” (ToS), “Terms of Use”, EULA (“End-User License Agreement”), “General Conditions” or “Legal Notes”.

The Terms and Conditions are nothing other than a contract in which the owner clarifies the conditions of use of its service. Some quick examples are the use of the content (copyright) , the rules that users must follow while interacting with one another on the website / app and, finally, rules related to the cancellation or suspension of a user’s account etc.

Particular emphasis should be given to the limitation of liability clauses (and disclaimers) , for example the case of malfunctions of the app or website.</string>
